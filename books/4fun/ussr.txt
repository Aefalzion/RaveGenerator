An unbreakable union of free republics,
The Great Russia has welded forever to stand.

Long live the creation of the will of the people,

The united, mighty Soviet Union!
Be glorious, our free Motherland,
A reliable stronghold of the peoples' friendship!
Banner of the Soviets, Banner of the people,
May it lead from victory to victory!
Through tempests the sun of freedom shone to us,
And the great Lenin illuminated our path,

We were raised by Stalin to be true to the people,

To labour and heroic deeds he inspired us!
Be glorious, our free Motherland,
A reliable stronghold of the peoples' happiness!
Banner of the Soviets, Banner of the people,
May it lead from victory to victory!
We grew our army in battles,
We will sweep the vile invaders out of the way!

We shall in battle decide the fate of generations,

We shall lead to glory our Motherland!
Be glorious, our free Motherland,
A reliable stronghold of the peoples' glory!
Banner of the Soviets, Banner of the people,
May it lead from victory to victory!
